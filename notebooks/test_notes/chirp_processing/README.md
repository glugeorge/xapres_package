# Chirp Processing
These are the definitive notebooks for obtaining profiles from the Greenland Lakes field data. There are 3 notebooks, one for each station. Each station's notebook will also look at the data season by season. The way the processing goes is, for each attenuator setting, we identify a threshold for clipping. Then we identify where clipping occurs. Normally, this is dominant in the first half of the chirp, so we will apply a half waveform to the chirp. Next, if there are still bursts that contain chirps with clipping, we discard up to 10 chirps from that burst that have clipping. If any chirps with clipping still remain, we ignore that burst. We then cut the chirp to remove any artifacts in data (ignoring the last 2 and first 200 samples). Then we demean, detrend, taper, pad, and take the fourier transform to obtain the profiles.
